I&rsquo;m not quite there yet, but I&rsquo;ll get there. That&rsquo;s different from making the most money developing software, or starting a software company. I <em>do</em> make good money. But that&rsquo;s not what all this is about.</p> <p>I think <strong><em>you might want to be a software developer for a long time</em></strong>, in the same way that some people are musicians for a long time, or artists for a long time, or roofers for a long time. If not, you can hit &ldquo;back&rdquo; in your browser. It&rsquo;s cool, no harm no foul. But I think maybe <strong><em>you</em></strong> would like to be a twenty-year programmer, or forty-year, or more.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what language or framework to learn. If you&rsquo;re good at the basics you can learn anything you want. Until then, you can be bad at whichever one you want. That&rsquo;s what I did, anyway.</p> <p>Instead I&rsquo;ll talk about things that didn&rsquo;t make sense to me when I started, and now they&rsquo;re the guiding stars in my sky. That means it&rsquo;s not about specific technologies. Technologies come and go. Languages come and go. They can&rsquo;t be your sky.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s start with this: software is young. </p> <h2>Software Development is Young</h2>'
